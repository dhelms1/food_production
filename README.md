## Introduction
The current world population is nearly 7.8 billion people, and this number is estimated to rise to around 9.7 billion in the year 2050. This means within the next 30 years, we will need to feed two billion more people without sacrificing the planet. This means we will need to double our crop production in order to feed that growing population. Agriculture is one of the greatest contributors of global warming, with farming consuming immense amounts of our water supplies and leaving major pollutants as its byproduct from fertilizer runoff. This leads to the question, how do we supply the necessary amount of food for a growing world population without sacrificing the climate of our planet?

## Data
Two different datasets will be used in the analysis, one coming from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production) and one coming from [FAO](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/OA) (the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). The use cases for each dataset is as follows:
- The Kaggle dataset will be used in analyzing food production, seeing which countries produce the most and if it is for human or livestock consumption. This data will also be used to cluster countries together based on their production levels, ideally separating high and low producing countries. 
- The FAO dataset will be used to compare the global population to the yearly total food production, as well as further analyzing the highest producing countries to see if they have the largest/fastest increasing populations.
